  <h1>Currying in JavaScript</h1><br>
  <b>Currying is a functional programming technique.</b>
  
  <p>
    This article will discuss currying, a functional programming technique we can use to write code that is modular, easy
    to
    test, and highly reusable. Functional programming is a declarative paradigm that emphasizes immutability and pure
    functions — meaning the function is side-effect free and for any given input it will always return the same output.
  
    This helps make code more readable and easier to reason about in general, and currying is just one part of it. Let&rsquo;s
    get
    started with currying!
  </p>
  
  <h2>How currying works</h2>
  <p>
    In order to understand the point of currying and how it works, we can first look at a non-curried function.
  
    Below, we&rsquo;ve created a non-curried function <i>add()</i>. <i>add()</i> will still execute if called with a missing
    argument, which
    would result in the missing variable being evaluated as undefined. For the <i>add()</i> function below, if
    <i>add()</i> was called
    with an argument for a but not for b, the function call would evaluate as 1 + undefined and return NaN. That&rsquo;s not
    great
    and could be tricky to debug in practice.
  </p>
  
  <i>
    <pre>
      function add(a,b) {
      return a + b;
      }
    </pre>
  </i>
  
  <p>
    Why does this happen? If <i>add()</i> is missing an argument when it&rsquo;s called, it will evaluate the function call as
    add(a,
    undefined). For example, if we use 1 as an argument for the variable a and no argument for b, calling add(1) would run
    as add(1, undefined).
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    Function call: → Evaluated as:
    add(1) → add(1, undefined)
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    Let&rsquo;s curry the <i>add()</i> function to see how we can handle the function call better if only one argument is
    available. What
    we can do is transform the <i>add()</i> function, which normally expects multiple arguments, into a series of nested
    functions
    that will each take a single argument.
  
    This makes the function calls more modular. With curried functions, calling the outer function returns the next
    function
    in the chain and so on until the innermost function is called, which then returns a value.
  
    In code that would look like this:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    // traditional function
    function add(a,b) {
    return a + b;
    }
    
    // curried function
    function curried_add(a) {
    // The outer function returns a nested single-argument function
    return function nested_func(b) {
    return a + b;
    }
    }
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    What we did in the code is declare <i>curried_add()</i> as a function that takes a single argument and returns another
    function
    named <i>nested_func()</i>. (The returned function can also be anonymous, but has a name in this example for clarity.)
  
    Calling the outer function <i>curried_add()</i> returns <i>nested_func()</i>.
    Calling nested_func uses the arguments supplied from calling curried_add and nested_func to return the evaluated
    result
    of a + b.
    When you call <i>curried_add(a)</i>, the returned output is the function <i>nested_func(b)</i>. Then you can call <i>nested_func(b)</i> and
    the output will be the evaluated result of a + b.
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    Function call: → Returns:
    curried_add(1) → nested_func(b)
    nested_func(b) → a + b
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    You can call that in your code as <i><b>curried_add(a)(b)</b></i>, which invokes <i>curried_add()</i>, then invokes
    <i>nested_func()</i> immediately
    following the first function call.
  
    Let&rsquo;s break that down further. In the code block below, we are assigning the result of calling <i>curried_add()</i> to
    a
    variable named <i><b>add_one</b></i>.
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    let add_one = curried_add(1);
    // returns <i>nested_func()</i>
  </pre>
  
  <p>Now, when we call <i>add_one()</i>, it will return the value of a + b, because it is the function <i>nested_func()</i>.</p>
  
  add_one(10);
  // returns 11
  
  <p>
    The argument from calling <i>curried_add()</i> is available to the nested functions due to closure. A closure means
    that the
    nested function retains the scope of parent functions based on where the function is defined, even if the nested
    function is executed outside of that lexical scope.
  
    You may recall that a function can access variables both in its inner and outer scope. That behavior is an example of
    lexical scoping rules, which means the scoping is based on the structure of the code.
  
    Taking that one step further, when a function is invoked, lexical scoping is retained. So nested functions will
    continue
    to have access to any variables that are declared in the outer scope of parent functions. This is true even if that
    parent function is done executing.
  
    Overall, that means that when you run the line let add_one = curried_add(1); , <i>add_one()</i> will retain the scope from
    curried_add() and therefore have access to the variable created for the argument a as 1, which you can see explained
    in
    the code snippet line by line:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    function curried_add(a) {
    // has access to the argument for a
    return function nested_add(b) {
    // has access to the arguments for a and b
    return a + b;
    }
    }
    
    // creates a local variable a and assigns it the value 1
    let add_one = curried_add(1);
    
    // add_one() still has access to the argument from curried_add()
    add_one(10);
  </pre>
  
  
  -------------------------------<br>
  <i>Code Challenge</i>
  <p>
    Declare a variable named <i>nestedFunction</i> and set it equal to <i>curriedMultiply()</i> called with a number
    argument.  
    Declare a second variable, <i>result</i> and set it equal to <i>nestedFunction()</i> called with a number argument.  
    If you <i>console.log() result</i>, it should log a number.
  </p>
  
  
  <pre>
    function curriedMultiply(a) {
    return function(b) {
    return a * b
     }
    }
  </pre>
  <pre>
    // Write your code here
    const nestedFunction = curriedMultiply(2);
    const result = nestedFunction(4);
  </pre>
  ----------------------------------------------
  
  -------------------------------------
  <i>Code Challenge</i><br>
  The function <i>makeGreeting()</i> takes one string argument.<br>
  
  Write additional code to make <i>makeGreeting()</i> return a function.<br>
  
  The returned function should return a concatenation of the first string, a space, and the second string, such as “Hello
  World”.<br>
  
  You can uncomment the lines below the function to check your work.
  
  
  <pre>
    function makeGreeting(string) {
    //Write your code here
    return string2 => {
    return string + ' ' + string2;
    }
    
    }
  </pre>

  <pre>
    let hello = makeGreeting('Hello');
    let helloWorld = hello('World');
    console.log(helloWorld);
  </pre>
  ----------------------------------------
  
  <h2>Currying with Arrow Functions</h2>
  <p>The same <i>curried_add()</i> function from earlier can be rewritten much more concisely using ES6 arrow function
    syntax:</p>
  
  <pre>let curried_add = a => b => a + b;</pre>

  <p>Let&rsquo;s break that down:</p>
  <ul>  
    <li><i>let curried_add</i> is a variable assignment to the outer arrow function, a => ....</li>
    <li>Calling <i>curried_add</i> takes an argument <i>a</i> and returns <i>b => a + b</i>.</li>
    <li>Invoking the second arrow function returns the sum, or <i>a + b</i>.</li>
  </ul>
  
  -----------------<br>
  Code Challenge
  <p>Rewrite the function <i>changeColor()</i> with arrow expression syntax and assign it to the variable
    <i>changeColorArrow</i>.</p>
  
  <pre>
    function changeColor(color) {
    return function(obj) {
    obj.color = color;
    }
    }
  </pre>
  
  <pre>
    // write your code here
    let changeColorArrow = color => obj => obj.color = color;
  </pre>
  -----------------
  
  
  <h2>Currying in Context</h2>
  <p>
    Now that we understand the basics of how currying works, let&rsquo;s look at a use case that&rsquo;s more interesting than
    addition.<br>
  
    For this example, a social sports league company needs a way to filter through an array of players from various
    cities,
    sports leagues, and age brackets to generate some graphs about their player data in a dashboard.<br> Each time they
    generate
    a list of filtered values, they have to repeat filters that iterate over the entire <i>players</i> array, so they want
    to
    modify their code.
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    const players = [
    { age: 5, sport: "soccer", city: "Chicago", dateJoined: new Date('2021-01-20') },
    { age: 6, sport: "baseball", city: "Boulder", dateJoined: new Date('2019-12-30') },
    { age: 10, sport: "soccer", city: "Chicago", dateJoined: new Date('2020-11-12') },
    { age: 11, sport: "handball", city: "San Francisco", dateJoined: new Date('2020-08-21') },
    { age: 6, sport: "soccer", city: "Chicago", dateJoined: new Date('2021-07-06') },
    { age: 8, sport: "softball", city: "Boulder", dateJoined: new Date('2019-02-27') },
    { age: 7, sport: "tennis", city: "San Francisco", dateJoined: new Date('2019-05-31') },
    { age: 4, sport: "handball", city: "San Francisco", dateJoined: new Date('2018-03-10') }
    ]
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    Let&rsquo;s say they&rsquo;re interested in seeing all players from the city of San Francisco sorted by age as well as seeing all
    players in San Francisco who play handball. We can filter over the array of objects to grab the relevant objects, then
    sort the results or do additional filtering.
  
    Below, <i>sortPlayersByValueFromCity()</i> takes three arguments:
  </p>
  
  
  <ul>
    <li>an array of players</li>
    <li>the city to filter by</li>
    <li>a sort key to sort by</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The function filters the array of objects by the city key, then sorts by the sort criteria.</p>
  
  <pre>
    const sortPlayersByValueFromCity = (playersArr, city, sortKey) => {
    return playersArr.filter(player => {
    return player.city === city;
    }).sort((a,b) => {
    return a[sortKey] - b[sortKey]
    });
    }
    
    console.log(sortPlayersByValueFromCity(players, "San Francisco", "age"));
  </pre>
  
  <p>Meanwhile, in the following code block, <i>filterPlayersByValueFromCity()</i> takes four arguments:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>an array to filter</li>
    <li>a city to filter the array by</li>
    <li>an additional filter key,</li>
    <li>the matching filter value to search for</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The function filters by the city then filters the results by the key-value pair.</p>
  
  <pre>
    const filterPlayersByValueFromCity = (playersArr, city, filterKey, filterValue) => {
    return playersArr.filter(player => {
    return player.city === city;
    }).filter(playersFromCity => playersFromCity[filterKey] === filterValue)
    }
    
    console.log(filterPlayersByValueFromCity(players, "San Francisco", "sport", "handball"));
  </pre>
  
  <p>There are a couple things you should notice about those functions:</p>
  
  <li>
    Both functions are filtering by city and performing the same filter each time the function is executed for San
    Francisco.
  </li>
  <li>Both functions take several arguments.</li>
  <p>
    Let&rsquo;s make the code more modular with currying to eliminate potential problems in the code and to avoid repeating the
    repetitive filter operations.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Identify errors faster</h2>
  
  <p>
    Say that we call <i>filterPlayersByValueFromCity()</i> as <i>filterPlayersByValueFromCity(players, "San Fran",
      "sport")</i>. The
    returned result is going to be an empty array. There are several things wrong with that function call, but it will
    still
    run and it will be unclear why an empty array was returned. The errors include:
  </p>
  
  <li>San Francisco is input as San Fran.</li>
  <li>The fourth argument is missing.</li>
  <p>
    As we covered earlier in the article, with currying, we can guarantee the final filter will not execute until all
    arguments have been entered and each nested function has been called. Since you&rsquo;re handling each argument one off in
    single argument functions, you can handle validating each argument as you go through the chain and hone in on any
    argument errors before code proceeds or has a chance to return an empty array.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Make Code Easier to Read and Reuse</h2>
  The code for <i>sortPlayersByValueFromCity()</i> and <i>filterPlayersByValueFromCity()</i> is hard to read. With
  currying, we can
  write functions that handle one task, and are therefore not only easier to read and understand, but more reusable. For
  example, we can create a curried function that filters an array of objects by a provided key and value.
  
  <pre>
    const setFilter = array => key => value => array.filter(x => x[key] === value);
    const filterPlayers = setFilter(players);
    const filterPlayersByCity = filterPlayers('city');
    const filteredPlayersBySanFrancisco = filterPlayersByCity('San Francisco');
    const filterPlayersBySport = filterPlayers('sport');
    const filteredPlayersBySoccer = filterPlayersBySport('soccer');
    
    console.log(filteredPlayersBySanFrancisco); // Returns an array of players from San Francisco
    console.log(filteredPlayersBySoccer); // Returns an array of players that play soccer
  </pre>
  
  <h2>Make Code More Modular</h2>
  <p>
    Now we can reuse the filtered San Francisco object for additional specialized functions. Let&rsquo;s use it to sort the
    players by the date they joined the sports league.
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    const sortArrayByValue = sortArray => sortKey => {
    return sortArray.sort(function(a, b){
    if(a[sortKey] < b[sortKey]) { return -1; } if(a[sortKey]> b[sortKey]) { return 1; }
      return 0;
      });
      }
    
    const sortSanFrancisco = sortArrayByValue(filteredPlayersBySanFrancisco);
    const sortSFByDateJoined = sortSanFrancisco("dateJoined");
    console.log(sortSFByDateJoined);
  </pre>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      In this article, we took a look at how currying works under the hood thanks to closures in JavaScript, and how you
      can
      use different syntax techniques to curry your functions. Overall, thanks to the modularity of curried functions, you
      can now use currying in your code to make your functions have a single purpose and therefore be easier to test,
      debug,
      maintain, and read.
